Markdown is pretty cool if you ask me.

## You can have lists

### Numbered
1. me first!
1. I'm second!
1. third :(

### Unordered
* Cheese
* is actually
* really good

And **lots** of other *fun* stuff.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

### Subscript
H~2~0

### Footnote
Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]

### Definition lists
Term 1

:   Definition 1

Term 2

:   Definition 2
    Third paragraph of definition 2.

### Abbreviation
*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
*[W3C]:  World Wide Web Consortium
The HTML specification
is maintained by the W3C.

### Add a class or other attributes to content.
